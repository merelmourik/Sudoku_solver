I am here to solve all your sudoku's!

To make the program enter "make" in the terminal.

The executbale is "sudoku_solver" and it expects one argument.

The argument is the unsolved sudoku with dots on the empty spaces, 
and a space between each row.
Example:
	./sudoku_solver "4.129..75 2..3..8.. .7..8...6 ...1.3.62 1.5...4.3 73.6.8... 6...2..3. ..7..1..4 89..651.7"

Or, if you wanna be lazy, just enter "make sudoku" and it will make the sudoku above.

Wanna challange the code by giving it an unsolvable sudoku?
I even prepepared this for you! Just run "make unsolvable".

Have fun!

Ps, I know it is not the fastest algorithm, but I made it so I'm proud :)
